### Who Is This Plugin For?

#### Car Dealers

Car dealers can use the Motors plugin to showcase their inventory online. By creating detailed listings with photos, videos, and descriptions, dealers can attract more buyers. For example, a car dealer can use the plugin to allow customers to request test drives directly from the listing page and many more. The plugin has features to post an unlimited number of car listings.

#### Dealerships

Dealerships can benefit from the Motors by managing multiple types of vehicles in one place. It makes selling items for vehicle dealers simple and fast. Whether they sell cars, motorcycles, boats, or trucks, Motors gives an opportunity to dealers to keep their listings effectively on WordPress sites. A dealership can set up categories for different vehicle types to help customers find what they’re looking for.

### Create a Listing with Ease

With the plugin, car dealers can add all the important details about the vehicle, like its make, model, year, and mileage. Plus, you can upload photos and videos to give buyers a good look at the vehicle from every angle.

You have the option to let the plugin come up with a title for you based on the vehicle’s details, or you can create your own to highlight its best features. The Motors plugin helps you fill in important info to your car listings on the WordPress site like the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), production date, and any history or maintenance records.

You can take it further by using premium pre-built page templates for each listing or creating your own custom layout using premium elements.

### Customize Listing Pages

The plugin allows you to choose how you want your car listings to appear, whether it’s in a grid or list format, to make it easier for buyers to browse through your WordPress site. You can also add buttons for test drives, loan calculators, and certification logos to help buyers make decisions faster.

The plugin lets you set options like registering users as vehicle dealers on your WordPress site. You can customize your site with the advanced features listed below:
- Search listings by location using Google Maps integration.
- Sort listings by custom fields—perfect for businesses that want to offer custom sorting options.
- Register users as Dealers or Dealerships, allowing multiple sellers to manage their own listings.
- Mark listings as Sold and display these listings with a "Sold" label, so customers can see the sold cars.
- Customize your URL structure for SEO-friendly listings for better search engine visibility.
